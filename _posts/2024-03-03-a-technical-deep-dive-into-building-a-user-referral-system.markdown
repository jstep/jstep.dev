# A Technical Deep Dive into Building a User Referral System

![referrals](/assets/Referrals.jpeg)

In today’s competitive landscape, building a robust user referral system is pivotal for companies aiming to expand their user base while nurturing customer loyalty. Let’s delve into the technical intricacies involved in creating such a system for your business, replacing specific terms with more generic ones like provider company and consumer company.

### Understanding the Core Components

A user referral system typically consists of several key elements:

1. **Referral Code/Link Generation**: Each existing user is assigned a unique referral code or link to share with potential new users.

2. **Tracking Mechanism**: The system must accurately track referrals to attribute rewards to referrers.

3. **Reward Management**: Defining and managing rewards for both referrers and referred users, often based on specific actions or transactions.

### Technical Implementation Roadmap

#### 1. MVP Development

Begin by developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), focusing on assigning a referrer to a user account and accurately tracking the fees generated by referrals.

#### 2. Sybil & Abuse Prevention

Implement measures to mitigate Sybil attacks and user fraud, such as an activation period requiring users to actively engage with the platform before referring others.

##### Device Fingerprinting:
While not foolproof, employing techniques like device fingerprinting can add an additional layer of security against abusive users.

##### Customizable Referral Limits:
Set opaque referral limits per user and adjust based on user activity or trading volume to prevent abuse.

#### 3. Payout Management

Design a system for timely and efficient payout management to avoid sending negligible amounts of rewards (dust) and incurring high network fees. Consider a laddered payout scheme to incentivize referrers over time.

#### 4. Wallet Linking & Terms

Facilitate wallet linking during onboarding to attribute referrals accurately and establish clear terms and conditions for the referral program.

### Technical Specifications

#### New Services:

- **ReferralsService**: Responsible for generating referral codes, tracking referral stats, and managing referral eligibility.
  
- **ReferralsCalculatorService**: Handles payout logic and mathematics.

#### Data Modeling:

Define database tables for user information, referral events, and payouts, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

#### Referral Tracking and Analytics:

Leverage database queries and frontend user actions tracking to monitor referral conversion rates, user activity, and revenue generated from referrals. Utilize this data to optimize the referral strategy continually.

Building a user referral system requires careful planning, meticulous execution, and ongoing optimization. By implementing the technical strategies outlined above, provider companies can create a mutually beneficial ecosystem for referrers, referred users, and the company itself, driving growth and fostering brand loyalty.
